# Movie Poster Project

You will design a movie poster step by step, using AI as a creative tool—not a shortcut.  
At each step, save and commit your work in GitHub Desktop.

## Using GitHub Desktop (Mac)

1. **Edit** this file (`movie-poster-project.md`) in TextEdit.  
2. **Save** your changes.  
3. Open **GitHub Desktop**.  
   - Check that `movie-poster-project.md` shows up under **Changes**.  
   - Write a commit summary (see below).

# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:** Twister
- **Movie Title:** Twister  
- **Why I chose this movie:** Because it was intresting. 

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:** Fear, nervous  

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:**  A tornado
- **Why this element:**  Because the whole movie is centered around tornados.

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:**  
Bright colors
**Color Palette:** Black and Gray  
- **Dominant color(s):** Black and Gray  
- **Accent color(s):** Clear rain  
- **Overall mood:** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)
dark  

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [X] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description:** A dark tornado the creates a sense of fear with a character hidden somewhere..

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**A dark tornado that creates a sense of fear with a person slightly smaller somewhere.  
- **What worked:** It was very unrealistic  
- **What didn't work:**  I wanted it to be less animated.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I'm going to have it use a dark color plate instead of just black.

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  A tornado that creates a sense of fear with a person slightly smaller somewhere that is very realistic with a dark color pallet More realistic it should look real. 

- **What worked:** It made it more realistic. 
- **What didn't work:**  The only dark colors.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I want to zoom out and have it include a field.

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:** A tornado that creates a sense of fear with a person slightly smaller somewhere that is very realistic with a dark color pallet More realistic it should look real. It doesnt have to be all black just the tornado and main colors. Also zoom out so that their is a field. 

- **What worked:**  I liked it being more zoomed out.
- **What didn't work:**  The character didn't work.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  Im going to make the character more hidden.

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**A tornado that creates a sense of fear with a person slightly smaller somewhere that is very realistic with a dark color pallet More realistic it should look real. It doesn't have to be all black, just the tornado and main colors. Also, zoom out so that there is a field. Make the character slightly more hidden.  

- **What worked:** I really like the character being more blended. 
- **What didn't work:**  I dislike how unrealisic the tornado looks.

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)  
4 because it was the most realistic.

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
